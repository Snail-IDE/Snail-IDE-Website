        <h2>Live Services/Events</h2>
        <p>As Snail IDE has a prominent event in the community, temporary changes may be made. For example a "live event." Live events are virtual events, players can choose to join
        into a multiplayer room to partcipate in some sort of minigame or possibly other things. Anyone who attempts to leak the full event could face serious punishment, however little bits won't be as important as these may be easier to find. </p>
